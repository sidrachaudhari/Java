# Heist Constraints (Read Carefully)

You must achieve the objective while respecting ALL constraints.

---

## ❌ Forbidden Actions

- You may NOT modify `Main.java`
- You may NOT change method signatures in `UserService`
- You may NOT remove existing validation logic
- You may NOT hardcode outputs

---

## ✅ Allowed Actions

- You MAY modify `User`
- You MAY add fields or methods to existing classes
- You MAY add new classes if absolutely necessary
- You MAY use collections and exceptions

---

## ⚠ Evaluation Rules

- If the program breaks → failure
- If constraints are violated → failure
- If behavior is correct but explanation is weak → partial credit

This is not about clever tricks.
This is about controlled design.

## 💡 Hint (Intentional, Minimal)

If you understood Recon,  
you already know **where this change belongs**.
