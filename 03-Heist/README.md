# Phase 3: Heist – Change Without Breaking

You now understand the system.

Your task is to **change its behavior**  
without destroying its structure.

This phase simulates real-world work:
- Requirements change
- Constraints exist
- You are judged by impact, not effort

---

## 🎯 Objective

The system must now:

> Allow users **under 18** to be stored  
> but **mark them as RESTRICTED**

The program must:
- Still run correctly
- Still print all users
- Clearly indicate restricted users

---

## 🧠 The Catch

You are **not free** to change everything.

Read the constraints carefully.
They exist for a reason.

---

## 📂 Target System

All required files are inside `target-system/`.

This is a **live system**.
Treat it with care.

---

## 🚪 First Action

👉 Open **`constraints.md`**

Do not code before reading it.
