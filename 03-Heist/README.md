# Phase 3: Heist – Controlled Intervention

This is where things change.

You now understand the system.
Your task is to **change it without breaking it**.

This phase simulates real-world pressure:
- Limited instructions
- Strict constraints
- No step-by-step guidance

---

## 🎯 Objective

You will be given:
- A target system
- A clear goal
- A set of constraints

Your job is to:
- Achieve the goal
- Respect all constraints
- Keep the system functional

How you do it is up to you.

---

## 📂 What’s Inside This Phase

- `target-system/`
  - The system you will modify

- `constraints.md`
  - Rules you must not violate
  - These matter more than elegance

Read **constraints first**.
Always.

---

## 🧠 How to Think During the Heist

- Small changes > big rewrites
- Understand impact before editing
- If something breaks, trace *why*

There is no “perfect” solution.
There are only **acceptable** and **unacceptable** ones.

---

## ⚠ Rules of Engagement

- Do not ignore constraints
- Do not rewrite everything
- Do not add unnecessary features

Breaking rules is worse than an imperfect solution.

---

## 🚪 Completion Criteria

You are done when:
- The goal is met
- Constraints are respected
- You can explain your decisions

When instructed, proceed to **Phase 4: Final Challenge**.
