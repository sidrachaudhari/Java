# Final Challenge: Student Access System

You are asked to design a small Java system to manage students and course access.

This is a **design + implementation** task.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Build a system that:

- Registers students
- Stores them in memory
- Determines whether they can access a course

---

## 📋 Requirements

Each **Student** must have:
- A name
- An age
- A unique student ID

Rules:
- Students under 18 are **RESTRICTED**
- Restricted students:
  - Can be registered
  - Cannot access the course
- Non-restricted students:
  - Can access the course

---

## ⚙ Functional Requirements

Your system must support:

1. Registering students
2. Listing all students
3. Checking if a student can access the course

Output format is up to you, but it must be clear.

---

## ⚠ Constraints

- Use **OOP properly**
- Use at least **one collection**
- Handle invalid input (e.g., negative age)
- Do not put all logic in `main`

---

## 🧠 What Is Being Evaluated

You will be evaluated on:

- Class design
- Responsibility assignment
- Use of collections
- Error handling
- Code clarity
- Explanation of decisions

Not:
- UI
- File handling
- Databases

---

## 📝 Submission Expectation

You should be able to explain:
- Why you designed the classes the way you did
- Where validation happens
- How access rules are enforced

---

## 🏁 Completion Criteria

You are done when:
- The program runs
- The rules are respected
- Your design makes sense

This concludes the Java Adventure.
