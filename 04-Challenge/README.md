# Phase 4: Final Challenge – No Training Wheels

This is the final phase.

There will be:
- Minimal guidance
- No examples
- No safety net

This is intentional.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Final Challenge

This phase tests whether you can:
- Analyze a problem independently
- Design a Java-based solution
- Make reasonable trade-offs
- Justify your decisions

This is not about speed.
This is about competence.

## 📂 What’s Inside

- `challenge.md`
  - Problem statement
  - Requirements
  - Evaluation criteria

Read it carefully.
Everything you need is there.

## 🧠 Expectations

You are expected to:
- Reuse concepts from training
- Apply lessons from recon
- Respect constraints like in the heist

There is more than one valid solution.

## ⚠ Final Note

If this feels difficult, that’s correct.

Difficulty here means:
- You are thinking
- You are deciding
- You are working like a developer

---

## 🏁 Completion

Completion is not perfection.
Completion is:
- A working solution
- Clear reasoning
- Honest effort

Good luck.
