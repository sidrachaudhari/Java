# Phase 1: Training Facility 

Welcome to the Training Facility.

This phase exists to give you the **core Java skills** you’ll need later.
Everything here is **guided**.
Later phases will not be.

If you take shortcuts now, you will feel it later.

## 🎯 Purpose of Training

Training is where you:

- Learn Java syntax and structure
- Understand *why* code works, not just *that* it works
- Build confidence with small, focused problems

You are not expected to be fast.
You are expected to be attentive.

## 🧩 How Training Missions Work

Each topic folder contains:

- A `README.md` → your mission briefing
- One or more `.java` files → examples or starting points

For every mission:
1. Read the README fully
2. Read the code before running it
3. Predict what will happen
4. Run or modify the code
5. Answer the questions mentally or in notes

There is no rush.
There is no leaderboard.
There is only understanding.

## 🧠 Rules Inside the Training Facility

- Do not skip topics
- Do not copy code blindly
- Do not memorize without testing

You are allowed to:
- Break the code
- Experiment
- Ask “what if?”

That’s how learning happens.

## 🗺 Training Areas

You will move through these areas in order:

1. `basics/` – Java structure and syntax
2. `oop/` – How Java models the real world
3. `collections/` – Working with groups of data
4. `exceptions/` – Handling errors properly

Each area prepares you for **Recon and the Heist** later.

## 🚪 Where to Start

👉 Begin with **`basics/README.md`**

Take your time.
This phase builds your foundation.
