# Mission 3: Inheritance – Reuse With Meaning

Inheritance allows one class to reuse another.

Used correctly, it reduces duplication.
Used poorly, it creates confusion.

This mission focuses on **when inheritance makes sense**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Create a base class
- Extend it using inheritance
- Reuse behavior without rewriting code

---

## 📂 Files

- `Vehicle.java`
- `Car.java`

---

## 🧪 Instructions

1. Open `Vehicle.java`
2. Identify common behavior
3. Open `Car.java`
4. Observe how it inherits from `Vehicle`
5. Run the program
6. Add a new method to `Vehicle` and see how `Car` gets it automatically

---

## 🧠 Questions to Think About

- What belongs in the parent class?
- What should stay in the child class?
- What happens if inheritance is overused?

---

## 🚪 Proceed When

You can explain:
- What `extends` does
- Why duplication is reduced
- How inheritance creates relationships
