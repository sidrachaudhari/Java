# Mission 1: Classes and Objects

A **class** is a blueprint.
An **object** is a real instance created from that blueprint.

This mission makes that difference concrete.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Create objects from a class
- Understand fields vs methods
- Observe how multiple objects behave independently

---

## 📂 File

`Main.java`

---

## 🧪 Instructions

1. Open `Main.java`
2. Identify:
   - The class definition
   - Fields
   - Methods
3. Run the program
4. Create a second object
5. Change values in one object and observe the other

---

## 🧠 Questions to Think About

- Why don’t objects share state?
- What happens if fields are `static`?
- Why does Java require `new`?

---

## 🚪 Proceed When

You can explain:
- What a class is
- What an object is
- Why two objects behave independently
