# Training Area: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Up to now, you have written **instructions**.

From this point forward, you will model **things**.

Java is not about writing steps.
It is about designing objects that:
- Hold data
- Expose behavior
- Interact with each other

If you misunderstand OOP, later phases will feel impossible.
Take this seriously.

## 🎯 What You Will Learn Here

- How classes become objects
- Why data hiding matters
- How behavior is shared and overridden
- How Java decides *which method to run*

This is not about definitions.
It is about behavior.

## 🧠 How to Study OOP

- Read the code before running it
- Ask “what object is responsible for this?”
- Modify small things and observe impact

If you ever think:
> “I’ll just memorize this”

Stop.
That will not work.

## 🗺 OOP Missions

Proceed in this exact order:

1. `01-classes-objects/`
2. `02-encapsulation/`
3. `03-inheritance/`
4. `04-polymorphism/`

Each mission builds on the previous one.
