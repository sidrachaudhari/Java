# Mission 4: Polymorphism – Same Call, Different Behavior

Polymorphism is where OOP becomes powerful.

The same method call can behave differently
depending on the object behind it.

This mission makes that visible.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Use a parent reference for child objects
- Override methods
- Observe runtime behavior

---

## 📂 Files

- `Shape.java`
- `Circle.java`
- `Main.java`

---

## 🧪 Instructions

1. Open `Shape.java`
2. Observe the method definition
3. Open `Circle.java`
4. Notice how the method is overridden
5. Run `Main.java`
6. Change the object type and observe behavior

---

## 🧠 Questions to Think About

- Which method is called at runtime?
- Why does Java choose that method?
- How does this enable flexibility?

---

## 🚪 Proceed When

You understand:
- Method overriding
- Runtime method dispatch
- Why polymorphism matters in design
