# Mission 1: Try and Catch – Controlled Failure

When something goes wrong, Java throws an exception.

If you don’t handle it:
- The program stops
- Everything fails

This mission shows how to control that.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Trigger an exception
- Catch it properly
- Prevent program crash

---

## 📂 File

`TryCatchDemo.java`

---

## 🧪 Instructions

1. Run the program as-is
2. Observe what happens
3. Wrap risky code in a try–catch block
4. Handle the exception gracefully

---

## 🧠 Questions to Think About

- What caused the exception?
- Where did it occur?
- What happens after it is caught?

---

## 🚪 Proceed When

You understand:
- Why the exception occurs
- How try–catch changes program flow
