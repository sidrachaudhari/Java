# Training Area: Java Basics

This is your first contact with Java as a language.

Here, you will learn:
- How a Java program is structured
- Where execution begins
- How output works

Nothing here is complicated.
But everything here is important.

## 🧪 Mission 1: Your First Program

File: `hello.java`

### Objectives
- Understand the role of `class`
- Understand the `main` method
- Understand `System.out.println`

### Instructions
1. Open `hello.java`
2. Read it line by line
3. Identify:
   - Class name
   - Main method
   - Print statement
4. Run the program

### Questions to Think About
- What happens if the class name changes?
- Why is `main` written exactly this way?
- What happens if a semicolon is removed?

Do not rush.
Experiment carefully.

## 🧪 Mission 2: Output Control

File: `output.java`

### Objectives
- Understand how Java prints output
- Observe execution order

### Instructions
1. Run the file as-is
2. Modify the text being printed
3. Add multiple print statements
4. Predict the output *before* running

### Questions to Think About
- Does Java print line by line?
- What controls where output appears?
- What happens if statements are reordered?

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

Java is **strict**, but predictable.

If you respect its rules, it behaves reliably.
If you ignore them, it refuses to cooperate.

That behavior is a feature, not a flaw.

## 🚪 When You’re Ready

Proceed to the next training area when:
- You understand every line you ran
- You can explain *why* it works
