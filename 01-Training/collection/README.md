# Training Area: Collections

Real programs rarely work with one object.
They work with **many**.

Collections exist to:
- Store groups of objects
- Organize data efficiently
- Express intent through structure

Choosing the wrong collection is a design mistake.
This phase teaches you to avoid that.

## 🧠 How to Study Collections

For every mission:
- Observe what is allowed
- Observe what is prevented
- Try adding “wrong” data
- See what Java does

Java collections are strict for a reason.
