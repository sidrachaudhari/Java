# Phase 0: Orientation – How This Adventure Works

This repository is structured as a **learning adventure**, not a traditional syllabus.

You will move through phases that simulate how developers actually grow:
learning concepts, analyzing existing code, and solving problems under constraints.

You do **not** need to understand Git to succeed here.
Focus on **Java**.

## 🧭 How to Navigate This Repository

Each phase lives in its own folder.
You will be given links to the correct folders in order.

Inside every folder:
- Start with `README.md`
- Follow the instructions in order
- Open and read the `.java` files
- Modify or write code as instructed (locally or online)

## 📍 The Phases

| Phase | Focus |
|-----|------|
| Onboarding | Understanding the flow |
| Training | Learning Java concepts |
| Recon | Reading and understanding code |
| Heist | Applying Java under constraints |
| Final Challenge | Independent problem-solving |

You should **not jump ahead**.
Each phase assumes knowledge from the previous one.

## 🧠 How You Are Expected to Learn

- Read code carefully
- Run examples and modify them
- Predict outputs before executing
- Break code and observe what happens
- Reflect on *why* something works

If something is confusing, that’s normal.
Confusion is part of the process.

## ⚠ Expectations

- This is not a passive course
- Watching someone else code is not enough
- Understanding matters more than memorization

If you engage honestly, this repository will make you confident with Java.
