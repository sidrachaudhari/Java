# Phase 2: Recon – Reading Before Writing

You are now entering a different kind of learning.

Until now, you were **writing small programs**.
From this phase onward, you will mostly be **reading someone else’s code**.

This is intentional.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Recon

In the real world:
- You rarely write code from scratch
- You inherit existing systems
- You must understand code before changing it

Recon trains you to:
- Read unfamiliar Java code
- Trace execution flow
- Identify design and logic issues
- Explain *what* the code does and *why*

You are **not expected to fix anything yet**.

---

## 📂 What’s Inside This Phase

- `codebase/`
  - A small Java codebase
  - Not perfect
  - Not well-written on purpose

- `questions.md`
  - Guided questions
  - Focused on understanding, not solutions

---

## 🧠 How to Approach Recon

1. Do **not** run the code immediately
2. Read files top to bottom
3. Identify:
   - Entry points
   - Data flow
   - Method responsibilities
4. Only run the code after forming a hypothesis

Confusion here is expected.
If everything feels obvious, you are missing something.

---

## ⚠ Important Rules

- Do not modify the code in this phase
- Do not “fix” issues yet
- Do not skip the questions

Recon is about **observation**, not action.

---

## 🚪 When to Move On

You are ready to leave Recon when you can:
- Explain the code to someone else
- Predict behavior before execution
- Justify *why* something is a problem

When instructed, proceed to **Phase 3: Heist**.
